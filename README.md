A utility library that generates HTML embed tags for audio or video located on a given URL.
It also parses and validates given media URLs.

It currently works with [120+ services](docs/supported.md), including the most important ones like

- YouTube
- Dailymotion
- MyVideo
- Vimeo
- Ustream

etc. With community driven updates this aims to be a complete and up-to-date service wrapper lib.

It uses iframes if possible, and has a fallback on the embed object if necessary.
